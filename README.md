Project for image-based movie-genre recognition. Includes a curated dataset of 1,045 IMDB posters across four genres, comprehensive preprocessing (cleaning, normalization, annotation CSV, stratified splits, resizing), and PyTorch training pipelines. Transfer learning adapts Hugging Face ResNet-18 and EfficientNet-B0 to 4 classes (freezeâ†’unfreeze strategy). Results: ResNet-18 test accuracy 59.18%; EfficientNet-B0 test accuracy 65.82% (peak val 70.41%). Stack: PyTorch/torchvision, PIL, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib.
